        <p>B - You wanted <font color=red><b>me</b></font>, here I am.<br>
            J - I wanted to see what you would do and  you didn't <font color=red><b>disappoint</b></font> you let five people die then you let dent take your place, even to a guy like me, that's cold.<br>
            B - Where's  <font color=red><b>Dent?</b></font><br>
            J - Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were but I know the <font color=red><b>truth</b></font>. There is no going back, you have changed things, forever.<br>
            B - Then why do <font color=red><b>you</b></font> wanna  kill me?<br>
            J - <font color=red><b>Ha-ha-ha</b></font> (that laugh) I don't.. I don't wanna kill you, what would I do without  you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No, no, you...you complete me.<br>
            B - You are garbage who kills  for <font color=red><b>money</b></font>.<br>
            J - Don't talk like one of them. You are not. Even if you would <font color=red><b>like</b></font> to be, to them you are just a freak..like me, they need you right now. But when they don't.. They will cast you out like a leper you see their  morals, their code...its a bad joke, dropped at the first sign of trouble, they are only as good as the world allows them to be. I will show you, when chips are down these civilized people...<br>
            They will eat <font color=red><b>each</b></font> other, see. I am not a monster, I am just ahead of the curve.<br><br>
